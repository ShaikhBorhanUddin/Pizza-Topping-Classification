## üìà ROC Curve Analysis

The ROC curves for EfficientNetB4 (on the left) show that while the model generally performs well, the curve for the Mushroom class is slightly less steep compared to Basil and Pepperoni, indicating a relatively higher false positive rate for that category. Overall, it still achieves good separability, but not as tightly packed near the top-left corner as a near-perfect classifier would. On the other hand, ConvNeXtBase (on the right) demonstrates consistently strong ROC curves across all three classes ‚Äî Basil, Mushroom, and Pepperoni. The curves for ConvNeXtBase are closer to the ideal shape, hugging the top-left corner more tightly and indicating higher true positive rates with lower false positives across the board. This confirms that ConvNeXtBase is able to discriminate between pizza toppings more reliably compared to EfficientNetB4.

</p>

For ResNet101V2 (on the left) and VGG19 (on the right), the ROC curves also show strong class separability, although they slightly lag behind ConvNeXtBase. In ResNet101V2, the Pepperoni and Basil classes maintain high AUC behavior, but the Mushroom curve dips slightly compared to others, hinting at minor difficulty in distinguishing that category. Similarly, VGG19's ROC curves are overall strong but exhibit slight variability in the Mushroom class as well. Both models perform admirably, especially for Pepperoni, but the minor inconsistencies, especially around Mushroom classification, reveal that their class separability is not as uniformly high as ConvNeXtBase.

</p>

Overall, ConvNeXtBase again stands out with the most consistent and highest-performing ROC curves, confirming it as the top model in terms of both classification accuracy and class discrimination.

## üìâ Confusion Matrix

In the confusion matrices, EfficientNetB4 shows strong performance in correctly identifying Pepperoni pizzas but struggles more with distinguishing Basil pizzas, misclassifying a significant portion as Pepperoni. Mushroom classification also shows moderate confusion, which suggests that EfficientNetB4 has difficulty in separating the Mushroom category clearly from others. In contrast, ConvNeXtBase delivers an overall much stronger and more balanced classification across all three toppings. It maintains high true positives for Basil, Mushroom, and Pepperoni, with only minimal misclassifications between classes. Notably, it achieves particularly good separation for the Mushroom class, an area where EfficientNetB4 had visible confusion, reflecting ConvNeXtBase‚Äôs superior feature extraction and generalization ability in this task.

</p>

Looking at ResNet101V2 and VGG19, both models exhibit strong performance for Pepperoni pizzas, correctly classifying the majority of samples. However, they show slightly more confusion when it comes to Basil and Mushroom, particularly with ResNet101V2 where a noticeable portion of Basil samples are misclassified as Pepperoni. VGG19 manages better balance overall but still misclassifies some Mushroom pizzas as either Basil or Pepperoni, indicating a slight weakness in differentiating the more subtle topping differences. While both models handle Pepperoni exceptionally well, their slight struggles with Mushroom prevent them from matching the clean separation achieved by ConvNeXtBase.

</p>

Overall, **ConvNeXtBase** emerges as the most balanced and robust model among all, demonstrating superior accuracy and minimal class confusion across all pizza topping categories.

## üî• Grad-CAM Visualization

Since the dataset used for the Pizza Topping Classification project is relatively small and somewhat biased, perfect visual focus from the models was not expected. Grad-CAM visualizations help in interpreting how the models "see" the toppings and where they concentrate their attention during prediction. While basic visual localization was achieved, some inconsistencies and diffused focus areas were understandable given the data limitations. Additionally, more advanced visualization techniques like Grad-CAM++ or Score-CAM were not applied, as they would have been unnecessarily complex for the scope of this project.

</p>

The first two Grad-CAM images belong to EfficientNetB4, focusing on Basil and Mushroom pizzas. For the Basil pizza, the model predominantly concentrates its attention around the center where basil leaves typically appear, though there is noticeable attention spillover toward the edges. For the Mushroom pizza, EfficientNetB4 captures a broader activation across the pizza surface, identifying mushroom patches but with less sharply defined regions, indicating that while the model recognizes the topping, it does not localize it very precisely.
